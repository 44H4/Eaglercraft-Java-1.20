### Before you shut this down too, hear us out.
### Even before the team at mojang made a way to port Minecraft to chromebooks, Lax1Dude found a way and paved the road for the rest of us fellow developers. So if your team can make a crappy imtation of real Minecraft that can only be played at 15 FPS, why can't a group of teenagers do better?
### Eaglercraft will always live on! 🦅🧱

### If you are still unconvinced, read Lax1Dude's heartfelt plea [here](https://github.com/lax1dude/eaglercraftx-1.8).
